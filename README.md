Welcome to the "Youtube Whisperer" Colab notebook!

This notebook allows you to transcribe any YouTube video by simply providing the link to the video. The transcription will be automatically downloaded as a text file, using OpenAI's Whisper model, which is a state-of-the-art speech-to-text model.

To use the notebook, simply enter the link to the YouTube video that you want to transcribe and chose one of the Whisper models. **(By default: tiny)**
The transcription will be downloaded to your local machine as a text file.
