Welcome to the "Youtube Whisperer" Colab notebook!

This notebook allows you to transcribe any YouTube video, using OpenAI's Whisper model, which is a state-of-the-art speech-to-text model, by simply providing the link to the video. The transcription will be automatically downloaded as a text file, or as subtitles (.SRT) 

(SRT part is https://github.com/lectair 's code. thanks!)

To use the notebook, simply enter the link to the YouTube video that you want to transcribe and chose one of the Whisper models. **(By default: tiny)**
The transcription will be downloaded to your local machine as a text file.
